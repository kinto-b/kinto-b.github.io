                        I am a data scientist and statistician with expertise in R and a keen interest in process automation, package development, and applied statistics. Although I am most comfortable in R, I have varying degrees of experience with a number of other languages from SQL (fluent), through Python, LaTeX, HTML/CSS and JavaScript (intermediate), to C++ (beginner).
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        Outside of work, I am an active contributor to the open source software community, having developed or made large contributions to a number of R packages.

                        <p>
                            I am currently situated in the statistical methods team, where I am involved in broadly two kinds of work.
                            On the one hand, I carry out statistical procedures like survey weighting, bias assessment, and non-response analysis.
                            On the other hand, I am responsible for streamlining and automating data processing, analysis and reporting pipelines. Some of the things I have worked on in this latter capacity are
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Redesigning the SQL database and associated workflows that underpin the <a href="https://www.srcentre.com.au/our-research#life-in-aus">Life in Australia</a> study</li>
                            <li>Automating and standardising our survey weighting procedure</li>
                            <li>Developing a Shiny application with SQL-based user-management for multi-client reporting of small area estimates</li>
                        </ul>

                        <p>
                            I was the lead data scientist on the <a href="https://www.qilt.edu.au/surveys/student-experience-survey-(ses)">SES</a>,
                            which approaches hundreds of thousands of higher education students each year. In this capacity, I was responsible for
                            maintaining the data infrustructure throughout the full length of the pipeline from sample collection and validation,
                            through fieldwork operations and data processing, to report production.

                            <br />
                            <br />

                            In addition, I made key contributions to the in-house R package architecture and Shiny application suite. In particular, I

                        <ul>
                            <li>Authored and/or maintained the majority of in-house packages</li>
                            <li>Trained other data scientists in R package development, helping them to become maintainers in their own right</li>
                            <li>Developed a number of complex Shiny applications which became core to projects across the business, including one which won a company-wide competition</li>
                        </ul>

                            I was in charge of the community operations team,  which was responsible for ensuring that the application marketplace was running smoothly.
