\begin{small}

I am the technical lead on a variety of machine learning and data engineering projects including,

\begin{itemize}
\item Propensity and segmentation modeling, timeseries forecasting, natural language processing, 
Bayesian modeling (e.g. multilevel regression with poststratification), etc.
\item MLOps, automating training and model deployment pipelines, implementing APIs for accessing model predictions, etc. 
\item ETL/ELT pipeline design and maintenance, SQL database architecture
\item Development and maintenance of internal software packages, overall package ecosystem design

Some of the things I worked on in this role were,

\begin{itemize}
\item ETL pipeline maintenance and optimisation, often massively reducing computation time 
(some 100x improvements with clever use of matrix algebra) and code complexity
\item Process automation and simplification for scalability
\item Data visualisation and dashboarding (PowerBI, Tableau) and Shiny application development
\item Mentorship and technical guidance for more junior members of staff
\end{itemize}
