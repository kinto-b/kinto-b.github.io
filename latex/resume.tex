{\bf PERSONAL PROFILE} \\
\textcolor{gray}{\rule{2cm}{2mm}}
\end{large}
\vspace{5pt}

\begin{small}
I am a data professional with experience working in both modeling and engineering focused roles. No matter which side of the fence I'm on, I love writing clean, modular, well-organised code to solve challenging data problems. I am completely comfortable writing production-ready code in R and Python, and have a good deal of experience designing and maintaining SQL databases.\\

Outside of work, I am an active contributor to the open source software community, having developed or made large contributions to a number of R packages. I'm also an avid reader, particularly of philosophy, and a keen (though not very good!) rock

\vspace{5pt}

{\bf Data Scientist} \\
\textcolor{gray}{Social Research Centre | 2022 - Present} \\[3pt]
\begin{small}
I am currently shared between the data and statistical methods teams, spending half my time in each. This being the case, I work on a fairly wide variety of things.\\

On the one hand, I am responsible for carrying out various statistical procedures (e.g. weighting, small area estimation, propensity modelling, forecasting) and writing technical reports.\\

On the other hand, I am the technical lead on a variety of software engineering projects, typically focussed on data modeling, integration, processing, analysis and reporting, but often general application development. Some of the things I've worked on in this latter capacity are:

\begin{itemize}
\item Developing and deploying machine learning models, and designing the API access to them.

\item Developing a three-tier lottery application for setting up and running prize draws.

\item SQL database design and data pipeline architecture for various projects.

\end{itemize}

\end{small}

{\bf Data Engineer} \\
\textcolor{gray}{Social Research Centre | 2020 - 2022} \\[3pt]
\begin{small}
I was the lead data engineer on the {SES}, which approaches hundreds of thousands of higher education students each year. In this capacity, I was responsible for maintaining the data infrustructure throughout the full length of the pipeline from sample collection and validation, through fieldwork operations and data processing, to report production.\\

In addition, I made key contributions to the in-house package architecture and Shiny application suite. In particular, I

\begin{itemize}
\item Authored and/or maintained the majority of in-house packages

\item Trained other data professionals in package development

\item Developed a number of complex Shiny applications which became core to projects across the business, including one which won a company-wide competition

\end{itemize}

\end{small}
\vspace{0.5cm}
{\bf Team Lead} \\
\textcolor{gray}{Sidekicker | 2018 - 2020} \\[3pt]
\begin{small}
I was in charge of the community operations team,  which was responsible for ensuring that the application marketplace was running smoothly.\\

Alongside managing 15+ casual staff, I

\begin{itemize}
\item Performed data analysis using SQL and Python

\item Automated core processes to save \textasciitilde{}100hrs of labour-time per month

\end{itemize}
