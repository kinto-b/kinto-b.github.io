{\bf PERSONAL PROFILE} \\

\end{large}
\vspace{5pt}

\begin{small}
I am a data scientist and statistician with expertise in R and a keen interest in process automation, software engineering, and applied statistics. Although I am most comfortable in R, I have varying degrees of experience with a number of other languages from Python and SQL (fluent), through LaTeX, HTML/CSS and JavaScript and Rust (intermediate). \\

Outside of work, I am an active contributor to the open source software community, having developed or made large contributions to a number of R packages. More information and an expanded resume are available at https://kinto-b.github.io

\vspace{5pt}

{\bf Statistician} \\
\textcolor{gray}{Social Research Centre | 2022 - Present} \\[3pt]
\begin{small}
I am currently shared between the data and statistical methods teams, spending half my time in each. 
This being the case, I work on a fairly wide variety of things. 
On the one hand, I am responsible for carrying out various statistical procedures (e.g. weighting, 
small area estimation, propensity modelling) and writing technical reports. 
On the other hand, I am the technical lead on a variety of software engineering projects, 
typically focussed on data modeling, processing, analysis and reporting, but often general 
application development. Some of the things I've worked on in this latter capacity are:

\begin{itemize}
  \item Developing a three-tier lottery application for setting up and running prize draws.
  \item Deploying machine learning models and designing API access to them to retrieve predictions
  \item Redesigning the SQL database and associated workflows that underpin the Life in Australia study.
\end{itemize}

\end{small}

{\bf Data Scientist} \\
\textcolor{gray}{Social Research Centre | 2020 - 2022} \\[3pt]
\begin{small}
I was the lead data scientist on the SES, which approaches hundreds of thousands of higher education students each year. In this capacity, I was responsible for maintaining the data infrustructure throughout the full length of the pipeline from sample collection and validation, through fieldwork operations and data processing, to report production.
\\

In addition, I made key contributions to the in-house R package architecture and Shiny application suite. In particular, I

\begin{itemize}
  \item Authored and/or maintained the majority of in-house packages
  \item Trained other data scientists in R package development, helping them to become maintainers in their own right
  \item Developed a number of complex Shiny applications which became core to projects across the business, including one which won a company-wide competition
\end{itemize}
\end{small}

\vspace{0.5cm}
{\bf Team Lead} \\
\textcolor{gray}{Sidekicker | 2018 - 2020} \\[3pt]
\begin{small}
 I was in charge of the community operations team,  which was responsible for ensuring that the application marketplace was running smoothly. 
 Alongside managing 15+ casual staff, I performed data analysis using SQL and Python, and automated core processes to save ~100hrs of labour-time per month.
