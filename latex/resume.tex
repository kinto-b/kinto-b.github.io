{\bf PERSONAL PROFILE} \\

\end{large}
\vspace{5pt}

\begin{small}
I am a data scientist and statistician with expertise in R and a keen interest in process automation, package development, and applied statistics. Although I am most comfortable in R, I have varying degrees of experience with a number of other languages from SQL (fluent), through Python, LaTeX, HTML/CSS and JavaScript (intermediate), to C++ (beginner). \\

Outside of work, I am an active contributor to the open source software community, having developed or made large contributions to a number of R packages. More information and an expanded resume are available at https://kinto-b.github.io

{\bf Statistician} \\
\textcolor{gray}{Social Research Centre | 2022 - Present} \\[3pt]
\begin{small}
I am currently situated in the statistical methods team, where I am involved in broadly two kinds of work. 
On the one hand, I carry out statistical procedures like survey weighting, bias assessment, and non-response analysis. 
On the other hand, I am responsible for streamlining and automating data processing, analysis and reporting pipelines. Some of the things I have worked on in this latter capacity are

\begin{itemize}
  \item Redesigning the SQL database and associated workflows that underpin the Life in Australia study
  \item Automating and standardising our survey weighting procedure
  \item Developing a Shiny application with SQL-based user-management for multi-client reporting of small area estimates
\end{itemize}

\end{small}

\vspace{0.5cm}
{\bf Data Scientist} \\
\textcolor{gray}{Social Research Centre | 2020 - 2022} \\[3pt]
\begin{small}
I was the lead data scientist on the SES, which approaches hundreds of thousands of higher education students each year. In this capacity, I was responsible for maintaining the data infrustructure throughout the full length of the pipeline from sample collection and validation, through fieldwork operations and data processing, to report production.
\\

In addition, I made key contributions to the in-house R package architecture and Shiny application suite. In particular, I

\begin{itemize}
  \item Authored and/or maintained the majority of in-house packages
  \item Trained other data scientists in R package development, helping them to become maintainers in their own right
  \item Developed a number of complex Shiny applications which became core to projects across the business, including one which won a company-wide competition
\end{itemize}
\end{small}

\vspace{0.5cm}
{\bf Team Lead} \\
\textcolor{gray}{Sidekicker | 2018 - 2020} \\[3pt]
\begin{small}
 I was in charge of the community operations team,  which was responsible for ensuring that the application marketplace was running smoothly. 
 Alongside managing 15+ casual staff, I performed data analysis using SQL and Python, and automated core processes to save ~100hrs of labour-time per month.
