I was the lead data engineer on the [SES](https://www.qilt.edu.au/surveys/student-experience-survey-(ses)), which approaches hundreds of thousands of higher education students each year. In this capacity, I was responsible for maintaining the data infrustructure throughout the full length of the pipeline from sample collection and validation, through fieldwork operations and data processing, to report production. 

In addition, I made key contributions to the in-house package architecture and Shiny application suite. In particular, I

- Authored and/or maintained the majority of in-house packages
- Trained other data professionals in package development
- Developed a number of complex Shiny applications which became core to projects across the business, including one which won a company-wide competition
