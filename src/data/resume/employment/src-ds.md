I am currently shared between the data and statistical methods teams, spending half my time in each. This being the case, I work on a fairly wide variety of things.

On the one hand, I am responsible for carrying out various statistical procedures (e.g. weighting, small area estimation, propensity modelling, forecasting) and writing technical reports.

On the other hand, I am the technical lead on a variety of software engineering projects, typically focussed on data modeling, integration, processing, analysis and reporting, but often general application development. Some of the things I've worked on in this latter capacity are:

- Developing and deploying machine learning models, and designing the API access to them.
- Developing a three-tier lottery application for setting up and running prize draws.
- SQL database design and data pipeline architecture for various projects.
