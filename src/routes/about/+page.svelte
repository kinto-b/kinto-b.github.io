        Hello world! I'm Kinto Behr, a statistician and data scientist living in Melbourne, Australia.

        I am employed by the Social Research Centre where I work on a fairly wide variety of things, from exploring different approaches to gender in survey weighting, through R package development and maintenance, to application development.

        <br />
        <br />

        In my free time, I enjoy contributing to the open source community, hiking, and reading.

        Currently, I'm making my way through Robert Brandom's big book on Hegel, 'A Spirit of Trust'.

        At some stage I might get around to publishing my thoughts on it and other topics here on this website.

        <br />
        <br />

        Until then, you might like to see what I've been doing on <a href="https://github.com/kinto-b">github</a> or drop me a line at kinto.behr &#9728; gmail dot com.
